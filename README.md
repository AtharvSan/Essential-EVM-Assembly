EVM Assembly is layered with conceptual nuances. This resource aims to simplify foundational concepts for understanding EVM assembly. Topics are introduced from basics like bits bytes and gradually moving towards the complex topics like endianness, slot alignment and memory layouts. Notes are presented in a clear conscise manner with supporting diagrams for crucial concepts. Use this resource as a short notes refresher while you are on your journey to master the EVM.
